Simulation and control software for use with the [Robot Raconteur](https://robotraconteur.com/) framework developed by Wason Technlogy, LLC.

## Features

### Simulation
* Build realistic, beautiful 3D environments with accurate physics
* Use existing Robot Raconteur control programs
  * No need to change code when switching between simulation and real world environments
* Repeat historical movements from both simulations and real-world data

### Visualization
* Display sensor data in a 3d environment in real time
* Display joint angles, motor speeds, and other necessary information in a variety of graphs

### Control
* Log sensor/motor data to allow repeating physical motions in a simulated environment
* Manually control of robot with custom bindings
