Simulation and control software for use with the [Robot Raconteur](https://robotraconteur.com/) framework developed by Wason Technlogy, LLC.

# Features
### Simulation
* Build realistic 3D environments with accurate physics
* Use existing _Robot Raconteur_ control programs
  * No need to change code when switching between simulation and real world environments
* Repeat historical simulations
* Repeat physical movements in a simulation to get a closer look at the data
### Visualization
* Display sensor data and display in the 3d environment in real time
* Display joint angles, motor speeds, and other necessary information in a variety of graphs
### Control
* Log sensor/motor data to allow repeating physical motions in a simulated environment
* Manually jog motors on the physical robot
